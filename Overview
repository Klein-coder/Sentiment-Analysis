Sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews is a classic project in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that serves as an excellent introduction to text classification. The core objective is to build a model that can automatically determine whether a given movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. This has practical applications for summarizing public opinion, providing recommendations, and understanding audience feedback at scale.
